# SEC540 Resources and References
Just some useful stuff I'd like to remember from SEC540


## Cloud Infrastructure Security

### Configuration Management as Code 

#### Config Management as Code Hardening
- [Dev-Sec.io](https://dev-sec.io) - Open-source hardening framework
- [NSA SIMP Project](https://www.simp-project.com/) - More hardening guides
- Also see CIS Benchmarks and DoD STIG templates in Puppet


#### Config Management - Gold Image Pipeline
- Code Analysis: Ansible in place of semgrep
- Acceptance: Vagrant
- Building: Packer


#### Building a Test System
- **Phoenix Server**: Temporary resource for automated/smoke tests
    - Immutable and ephemeral
- [**Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/): Create dev envs aligned with prod. Good for local ephemeral on type-2 hypervisor
    - Ruby-based syntax for config
- [**Packer**](https://www.packer.io/): Good for type-1 hypervisors or cloud
    - Primary goal is not creating test VMs, but creating reusable images in the cloud
    - HCL syntax for config
- [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com/): Configuration management
    - Galaxy Hub collections for extensibility (ie hardening, distro specific config)


#### Automated Testing of Config Management Code
1) [**ansible-lint**](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/): pre-commit checks
2) [**ansible-test**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing.html): Unit and integration tests
3) [**KICS scanner by Checkmarx**](https://www.kics.io/index.html): check for dangerous Ansible code
4) [**Inspec**](https://community.chef.io/tools/chef-inspec): Stories to validate final config
    - These can become your compliance requirements
    - inspec exec from packer config


#### Building the Gold Image
- packer build command from CI/CD (ie Jenkins)



### Container Security
- [**NIST SP 800-190**](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/190/final) Application Container Security Guide

#### Dockerfile
- Supply chain risk: FROM command
- Common issue to see secrets in ENV which then get stored in registry layers

#### Pre-Commit Security - far left!

##### Static Analysis for Dockerfiles
- **hadolint**: parse Dockerfile into AST and runs rules
- **dockertfilelint**: 
- **dockerfile-lint**: 
- [**KICS scanner by Checkmarx**](https://www.kics.io/index.html): check for dangerous Ansible code

##### Image Supply Chain Risk Mitigation
- MITRE ATT&CK Containers T1525: Implant Internal Image (imgs from public registries may contain vulns or malware)
    - download, scan, and store in local registry
- Suppliers for BASE IMAGES:
    - docker Official Images, Verified Publishers
    - [**P1 Iron Bank**](https://p1.dso.mil/services/iron-bank)
    - [**MS Container Registry (MCR)**](https://mcr.microsoft.com)
    - [**AWS ECR Public Gallery - Verified Accounts**](https://gallery.ecr.aws)
- Trusted Supplier Policy
    - [**conftest**](https://www.conftest.dev): helps write custom policy using Open Policy Agent (OPA) rego, run tests agains structured config data
- Start with a MINIMAL base image
    - [**Google's Distroless images**](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless): only your apps and its dependencies (Java, NodeJS, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)
    - [**Alpine Linux images**](https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/): Security-oriented, light-weight Linux distros
    - **Scratch base images**: start with an empty image
    - Multi-stage builds: differentiate dev from runtime base images

##### Other pre-commit steps
- **Docker BuildKit build secrets**: to avoid hard-coding secrets
- **Docker Scan**: scan with Snyk vuln scanner before committing the Dockerfile
    - Free for a few scans per month, but eventually may need to subscribe


#### Vulnerability Scanning tools for CI/CD
- [**Anchore**](https://anchore.com/container-vulnerability-scanning/): moving very quickly, extensible scanning/policy enforcement
- [**CoreOS Clair**](https://quay.github.io/clair/): used by AWS under the hood
- **Dagda**
- **Docker Bench/Actuary**
- **OpenSCAP Plugin**
- [**Trivy**](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy): Container image scanning, can ignore unfixed vulns


#### Project Sigstore - software supply chain security
- OSSF project with heavy investment by chainguard dedicated to securing supply chain
- **cosign**: container signing, verification, storage in OCI compliant container registry 
    - `cosign sign` to sign, `cosign verify` to verify sig
- **fulcio**: free root CA for code signing certs. Issues short lived (20min) certs based on OIDC email (LetsEncrypt but for container certs)
- **rekor**: provides immutable ledger of sig transparency logs
- other projects in sigstore not covered here that are valuable


#### ECR Best Practices
- Isolate registries in dedicated DevOps account
- Restrict access using rsrc based and id-based IAM policies for x-account access (granular permissions for repo actions, scoped to specific repo for ECR)
- Protect prod imgs from corrupt or delete with immutable tagging (tag can be pushed once and never overwritten)
- Enable basic (integrated) or enhanced (Amazon Inspector) container img scanning

#### Runtimes
- Security hardening specific to the selected runtime
- Orchestrators:
    - AWS ECS/Fargate           // AWS EKS
    - Azure Container Service   // Azure Kubernetes Service
    - Google Cloud Run          // GKE
    - Red Hat Open Shift        // Kubernetes
    - Docker                    // Podman 

##### Orchestrator Security Risks
- API, admin console, backends, etc must all be hardened (RBAC to any API or other accesses)
- Don't rely on defaults! Deliberate config away from defaults
- Inter-container network traffic (service mesh): own dedicated network, invisible to traditional IDS, etc.
    - Tesla hack in 2018 due to kubernetes default no password protection

##### Kubernetes Security Guides
- [**Kubernetes Hardening Guide**](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Aug/29/2003066362/-1/-1/0/CTR_KUBERNETES_HARDENING_GUIDANCE_1.2_20220829.PDF): NSA, CISA guidance for admins of NSS
- [**Kubernetes Security - Operating Kubernetes Clusters and Applications Safely (eBook)**](https://kubernetes-security.info): free
- [**CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes**](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes): covers securing cp, etcd, cp config, worker nodes, policies

##### Kubernetes Security Tools
- **kubeaudit**
- **kube-bench**
- **kubesec.io**
- **conftest**: rego policies
- **sysdig falco**: runtime threat detection
- **k-rail**
- **kube-hunter**
- **kube-score**

##### Admission Controllers
- Custom hook to execute before starting a new container
- allows/denies to orchestrator before container starts
- **Integration**: sigstore has a cosigned admission controller helm chart
- AWS: no admission controller on ECS/Fargate:
    - Chainguard's Cosign ECS Verify project uses Event Bridge to detect ECS task events
    - Lambda funcs perform validation checks, stop non-compliant, send notifications
    - Not perfect, would likely stop after started, but doesn't allow running longer than 30sec or so

##### Commercial Container Security
- Palo Alto Prisma Cloud
- Aqua Sec
- Red Hat StackRox
- Trend Micro Cloud One
- Sysdig Secure/Monitor
- Anchore Enterprise

##### Falco Project
- runtime in kube cluster or in ECS repositories
- open-sourced hundreds of built-in rules 
- Detect malicious activity based on rules and logs+notifies

#### Additional Container Security Resources
- Container Security: Fundamental TEch Concepts that PRotect Cont Apps, Liz Rice ( runtime security)
- [**Container Security Checklist, Carol Valencia**](https://github.com/krol3/container-security-checklist) 
- CIS Benchmark for Docker
- Docker Bench


### Acceptance Stage Security Controls

#### Kindsof security tests
1) Live functional security tests
2) Targeted, non-functional tests against known security weakness and common mistakes
3) Security scanning of app and runtime infra
4) Security tests at app level

Typically best to start #3, #2, and slowly build up

#### Dynamic App Security Testing (DAST)
- Test the running application
    - web app, API, microsvcs, clients, etc
- Two types:
    - Active: send malicious data to tgt, to see how it responds
    - Passive: observe responses from target to id issues
- Challenges:
    - Time/skills needed to set up and train against the app
    - Getting auth set up and working in CI/CD can be tricky
    - Scanning resource-intensive
    - Time to execute scans: crawling too slow, tests need to run quickly
    - Scanners may hang or crash, esp on big apps with rich UIs
    - Time/skills needed to understand and qualify findings
    - May need to try out several scanners (and plugins) to find something that works
- Success factors:
    - Run headless, set up and control tests thru CLI/API
    - Parse results and ID pass/fail results
    - Filter out false pos and ignore dupe findings
    - choose between active/passive
    - Balance speed against completeness (smoke vs deep tests)
- Free Dynamic Analysis tools
    - OWASP ZAP: best open source scanner option right now.
    - Burp Suite: requires purchase to be entirely useful
    - Arachni: support dropped off for awhile
    - sqlmap: great for exploitation, but overkill for a CI/CD pipeline
