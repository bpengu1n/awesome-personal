# SEC540 Resources and References
Just some useful stuff I'd like to remember from SEC540


## Cloud Infrastructure Security

### Configuration Management as Code 

#### Config Management as Code Hardening
- [Dev-Sec.io](https://dev-sec.io) - Open-source hardening framework
- [NSA SIMP Project](https://www.simp-project.com/) - More hardening guides
- Also see CIS Benchmarks and DoD STIG templates in Puppet


#### Config Management - Gold Image Pipeline
- Code Analysis: Ansible in place of semgrep
- Acceptance: Vagrant
- Building: Packer


#### Building a Test System
- **Phoenix Server**: Temporary resource for automated/smoke tests
    - Immutable and ephemeral
- [**Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/): Create dev envs aligned with prod. Good for local ephemeral on type-2 hypervisor
    - Ruby-based syntax for config
- [**Packer**](https://www.packer.io/): Good for type-1 hypervisors or cloud
    - Primary goal is not creating test VMs, but creating reusable images in the cloud
    - HCL syntax for config
- [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com/): Configuration management
    - Galaxy Hub collections for extensibility (ie hardening, distro specific config)


#### Automated Testing of Config Management Code
1) [**ansible-lint**](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/): pre-commit checks
2) [**ansible-test**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing.html): Unit and integration tests
3) [**KICS scanner by Checkmarx**](https://www.kics.io/index.html): check for dangerous Ansible code
4) [**Inspec**](https://community.chef.io/tools/chef-inspec): Stories to validate final config
    - These can become your compliance requirements
    - inspec exec from packer config


#### Building the Gold Image
- packer build command from CI/CD (ie Jenkins)



### Container Security
- [**NIST SP 800-190**](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/190/final) Application Container Security Guide

#### Dockerfile
- Supply chain risk: FROM command
- Common issue to see secrets in ENV which then get stored in registry layers

#### Pre-Commit Security - far left!

##### Static Analysis for Dockerfiles
- **hadolint**: parse Dockerfile into AST and runs rules
- **dockertfilelint**: 
- **dockerfile-lint**: 
- [**KICS scanner by Checkmarx**](https://www.kics.io/index.html): check for dangerous Ansible code

##### Image Supply Chain Risk Mitigation
- MITRE ATT&CK Containers T1525: Implant Internal Image (imgs from public registries may contain vulns or malware)
    - download, scan, and store in local registry
- Suppliers for BASE IMAGES:
    - docker Official Images, Verified Publishers
    - [**P1 Iron Bank**](https://p1.dso.mil/services/iron-bank)
    - [**MS Container Registry (MCR)**](https://mcr.microsoft.com)
    - [**AWS ECR Public Gallery - Verified Accounts**](https://gallery.ecr.aws)
- Trusted Supplier Policy
    - [**conftest**](https://www.conftest.dev): helps write custom policy using Open Policy Agent (OPA) rego, run tests agains structured config data
- Start with a MINIMAL base image
    - [**Google's Distroless images**](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless): only your apps and its dependencies (Java, NodeJS, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)
    - [**Alpine Linux images**](https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/): Security-oriented, light-weight Linux distros
    - **Scratch base images**: start with an empty image
    - Multi-stage builds: differentiate dev from runtime base images

##### Other pre-commit steps
- **Docker BuildKit build secrets**: to avoid hard-coding secrets
- **Docker Scan**: scan with Snyk vuln scanner before committing the Dockerfile
    - Free for a few scans per month, but eventually may need to subscribe


#### Vulnerability Scanning tools for CI/CD
- [**Anchore**](https://anchore.com/container-vulnerability-scanning/): moving very quickly, extensible scanning/policy enforcement
- [**CoreOS Clair**](https://quay.github.io/clair/): used by AWS under the hood
- **Dagda**
- **Docker Bench/Actuary**
- **OpenSCAP Plugin**
- [**Trivy**](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy): Container image scanning, can ignore unfixed vulns


#### Project Sigstore - software supply chain security
- OSSF project with heavy investment by chainguard dedicated to securing supply chain
- **cosign**: container signing, verification, storage in OCI compliant container registry 
    - `cosign sign` to sign, `cosign verify` to verify sig
- **fulcio**: free root CA for code signing certs. Issues short lived (20min) certs based on OIDC email (LetsEncrypt but for container certs)
- **rekor**: provides immutable ledger of sig transparency logs
- other projects in sigstore not covered here that are valuable


#### ECR Best Practices
- Isolate registries in dedicated DevOps account
- Restrict access using rsrc based and id-based IAM policies for x-account access (granular permissions for repo actions, scoped to specific repo for ECR)
- Protect prod imgs from corrupt or delete with immutable tagging (tag can be pushed once and never overwritten)
- Enable basic (integrated) or enhanced (Amazon Inspector) container img scanning

#### Runtimes
- Security hardening specific to the selected runtime
- Orchestrators:
    - AWS ECS/Fargate           // AWS EKS
    - Azure Container Service   // Azure Kubernetes Service
    - Google Cloud Run          // GKE
    - Red Hat Open Shift        // Kubernetes
    - Docker                    // Podman 

##### Orchestrator Security Risks
- API, admin console, backends, etc must all be hardened (RBAC to any API or other accesses)
- Don't rely on defaults! Deliberate config away from defaults
- Inter-container network traffic (service mesh): own dedicated network, invisible to traditional IDS, etc.
    - Tesla hack in 2018 due to kubernetes default no password protection

##### Kubernetes Security Guides
- [**Kubernetes Hardening Guide**](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Aug/29/2003066362/-1/-1/0/CTR_KUBERNETES_HARDENING_GUIDANCE_1.2_20220829.PDF): NSA, CISA guidance for admins of NSS
- [**Kubernetes Security - Operating Kubernetes Clusters and Applications Safely (eBook)**](https://kubernetes-security.info): free
- [**CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes**](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes): covers securing cp, etcd, cp config, worker nodes, policies

##### Kubernetes Security Tools
- **kubeaudit**
- **kube-bench**
- **kubesec.io**
- **conftest**: rego policies
- **sysdig falco**: runtime threat detection
- **k-rail**
- **kube-hunter**
- **kube-score**

##### Admission Controllers
- Custom hook to execute before starting a new container
- allows/denies to orchestrator before container starts
- **Integration**: sigstore has a cosigned admission controller helm chart
- AWS: no admission controller on ECS/Fargate:
    - Chainguard's Cosign ECS Verify project uses Event Bridge to detect ECS task events
    - Lambda funcs perform validation checks, stop non-compliant, send notifications
    - Not perfect, would likely stop after started, but doesn't allow running longer than 30sec or so

##### Commercial Container Security
- Palo Alto Prisma Cloud
- Aqua Sec
- Red Hat StackRox
- Trend Micro Cloud One
- Sysdig Secure/Monitor
- Anchore Enterprise

##### Falco Project
- runtime in kube cluster or in ECS repositories
- open-sourced hundreds of built-in rules 
- Detect malicious activity based on rules and logs+notifies

#### Additional Container Security Resources
- Container Security: Fundamental TEch Concepts that PRotect Cont Apps, Liz Rice ( runtime security)
- [**Container Security Checklist, Carol Valencia**](https://github.com/krol3/container-security-checklist) 
- CIS Benchmark for Docker
- Docker Bench


### Acceptance Stage Security Controls

#### Kindsof security tests
1) Live functional security tests
2) Targeted, non-functional tests against known security weakness and common mistakes
3) Security scanning of app and runtime infra
4) Security tests at app level

Typically best to start #3, #2, and slowly build up

#### Dynamic App Security Testing (DAST)
- Test the running application
    - web app, API, microsvcs, clients, etc
- Two types:
    - Active: send malicious data to tgt, to see how it responds
    - Passive: observe responses from target to id issues
- Challenges:
    - Time/skills needed to set up and train against the app
    - Getting auth set up and working in CI/CD can be tricky
    - Scanning resource-intensive
    - Time to execute scans: crawling too slow, tests need to run quickly
    - Scanners may hang or crash, esp on big apps with rich UIs
    - Time/skills needed to understand and qualify findings
    - May need to try out several scanners (and plugins) to find something that works
- Success factors:
    - Run headless, set up and control tests thru CLI/API
    - Parse results and ID pass/fail results
    - Filter out false pos and ignore dupe findings
    - choose between active/passive
    - Balance speed against completeness (smoke vs deep tests)
- Free Dynamic Analysis tools
    - OWASP ZAP: best open source scanner option right now.
    - Burp Suite: requires purchase to be entirely useful
    - Arachni: support dropped off for awhile
    - sqlmap: great for exploitation, but overkill for a CI/CD pipeline



## Cloud Security Operations

### Azure vs AWS 
- Azure DevOps puts everything in a single pane of glass (no need for seperate Gitlab etc)
- AWS you push to microservices for build and deploy (ie CodePipeline, ECS/Fargate, S3, etc.)
- Shared responsibility considerations:
    - User Permissions: 
        - **Azure**: AD/EntraID for SSO but you must manage the directory
        - **AWS**: Executiuon roles for excessive permissions
    - Access:
        - **Azure**: Personal Access Token (PAT) expiration/scopes
        - **AWS**: CodeBuild jobs in secure customer-managed VPCs - least priv 
    - Extensions/Supply Chain
        - **Azure**: Review ADO extensions carefully before installing
        - **AWS**: CodeBuild base images need careful review/update
    - Secrets:
        - **Azure**: Secrets in Azure Key Vault 
        - **AWS**: Secrets in Secrets Manager

### Security Misconfigurations
- Permissive IAM/RBAC: unauth access, privesc, exfil
- Publicly exposed resources (buckets, svcs, data sets, etc)
- Failing to apply approp data protect and encrypt policies for data at rest and in transit
- Rinse and repeat for ALL cloud provider svcs

### Hardening Guides
- AWS ECS Security Guide
- EKS Security GUide
- Azure Kube Security Baseline
- GKE security hardening guide

### Questions to ask
- Do users approp have TLS req with load balancer

- TLS system-to-system?
- Identity assigned to container for talking w backend APIs
- resources comm with, policies appropriate?



### Cloud Security Monitoring
- security monitoring in DSO: Check out [etsy stories](https://codeiscraft.com) - look for Church of Graphs
    - https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/measure-anything-measure-everything?ref=codeascraft
- Open Telemetry

#### Roadmap
1) Enable appropriate logs
2) Store in central location
3) Enable automation
4) Leverage a threat detection svc

#### AWS Monitoring Services
- CloudTrail: records history of activities (Mgmt Events and optionally data events) in AWS accounts
    - USe AWS Organizations - turn on CT logs via org root and org trail: provides a centrally configured CT
        - ensures enabled by default for all new accts
        - cannot be disabled by child accounts
- VPC Flog Logs: Network logging, network traffic metadata to be captured within cloud network
    - capture for entire VPC, indiv subnet, or specific net interface
    - Aggregate statistics, not full pcap
    - Not on by default!
- CloudFront and S3 Access Logs
- ALB Access Logs
- CloudWatch
    - Allows generating logs, and building metrics
    - Log insights: custom language for filtering
    - Graphing built metrics
    - Alarm and Slack notifications (or otherwise via Lambda)
- GuardDuty: Threat detection service
    - They say you can keep VPC Flow Logs etc disabled - instructor disagrees firmly
        - Do you really want to hand off all your network monitoring to Guard Duty, vs keeping your team's eyes on what's happening? 
        - Could be very bad for incident response to not have the info from other logging

#### Continuous Monitoring at Etsy
- Put as many different graphs together as possible 
    - Helps gain support for security initiatives, communicate effectively

#### Third-party Security Monitoring
- Very important for multi-cloud visibility

#### Tools
- osquery: agent on VMs to generate OS-level data (apps, procs, files, open ports, etc.)
    - Can query via SQL
    - Scaling: **Uptycs** provides SaaS platform for this
    - Use Cases
        - change control
        - sw inventory, vuln mgmt 
        - threat hunt
        - compliance auditing
        - incident response, forensics analysis
        - Example query (new processes listening on network ports):
        ```sql 
        SELECT DISTINCT process.name, listening.port, listening.address, process.pid FROM processes AS process JOIN listening_ports AS listening ON process.pid = listening.pid;
        ```
    - CloudQuery (for all cloud providers)
    - KubeQuery: query Kubernetes resources running anywhere and centralize information for query and visualization


## Cloud Security as a Service

### Microservice Security

#### Identity / Enterprise Federation
- Supported by both AWS and Azure:
    - SAML
    - OIDC (Web Identity Federation)
        - Supported authentication against OIDC compat id providers
        - OAuth or JSON Web Token back when authenticated
        - On infra, specify trust of the OIDC source 
    - Other SaaS providers:
        - Ping Identity: Enterprise-lvl id prov for SSO, mfa, API access, dir svcs
        - ForgeRock: enterprise-level AM, IM, API gw, dir svcs
        - Okta: Enterprise-level id, mobile, SSO 
        - Auth0: dev-focused auth provider for social and enterprise login providers, aquired by Okta in 2021
        - Stormpath: dev-focused auth provider aquired by Okta in Aug 2017
    

#### Authorization and Access Control
- JWT pieces: b64(head).b64(payload).b64(sig)
    - Header: algorithm for signing
    - Payload: whatever you want in here, but must include some fields per spec
    - Sig: priv or pub/priv key pair to HMAC sign payload.
- JWT Critical Vulnerability
    - Changing algorithm to None and eliminating signature. Does it get accepted? YES
- JWT Best Practices
    - JWS signs header/payload using HMAC priv key (REQUIRED)
    - Sig verify must ignore header alg value and ALWAYS verify sig
    - JSON Web Encrypt is only way to ensure confidentiality of payload
    - Expiration using creation (iat) and expiration (exp) claim
    - Check issue (iss) claim against list of trusted issuers
    - Check audience (aud) claims to ensure JWT is meant for you
    - Prevent replay attacks using a nonce in JWT ID (jti) claim
- Azure uses JWT under the hood for API access mgmt

#### Service Mutual TLS Authentication
- PKI to achieve both client auth and encrypt over HTTPS between ALL nodes

#### Service Mesh
- More common now to use a mesh like istio to manage all these connections, access ctrl, cert mgmt
- Sidecar proxies for services manage connections
- Options: Istio, linkerd, consul, app mesh, etc.

#### Azure API Management 
- One-stop shop for managing all APIs in Azure
#### AWS



### Serverless Security

#### What is Serverless?
- "Event-driven computing"
- Examples: AWS Lambda, MS Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions; Amazon API Gateway


#### Benefits
- no servers to manage, just hand off code to run
- apps scale with usage
- no expenses for idle time
- availability/fault tolerance built in
- functions can be combined w/ API gateway for fully serverless microsvcs


#### How does serverless make security harder
- Bigger/different attack surface 
- Authentication and access control
- Compliance


#### Container runtime persistence
- Are serverless envs actually stateless and ephemeral?
    - implemented differently depending on provider
    - cold vs warm execution envs demonstrated by response time difference
    - warm functions present security risk if compromised containers kept alive
    - AWS Lambda functions recycle after about 12min
    - Azure closer to 8min
    - GCP down to ~3min
    - But cool-down time is not configurable or exposed 

#### Application Security
- App sec is even more important with serverless
- OWASP Top 10 best practices 

#### Serverless security Resources
- [**OWASP Serverless Top 10 Project**](https://owasp.org/www-project-serverless-top-10/): most common vulns in serverless functions
- [**Serverless Prey project**](https://github.com/pumasecurity/serverless-prey): functions for RE of serverless exec envs
- [**OWASP ServerlessGoat project**](https://github.com/OWASP/Serverless-Goat): vuln serverless tgt func that parses txt from wrod docs
- [**Damn Vuln Serverless App (DVSA)**](https://github.com/OWASP/DVSA): provides a vuln tgt env for pen testing

#### Serverless Security Use Cases
- Can be leveraged to improve security
    - Security Automation: Bots, scrapers, scan blocks, update block lists, etc
    - Use an API gateway (serverless by nature)

#### Other stuff
- for both AWS + Azure, you can bring your own container for lambda funcs, but it adds extra work

#### AWS Lambda Layers
- Can add up to 5 layers per function


## Compliance as Code
- Shifting towards performing our audits using real-world workloads
- Take auditors through process demonstrating the security control validations for a single small merge

### Devops and Compliance -- We need to TRULY UNDERSTAND the audit framework
- Understand what the checklist says, and what it actually means applied to our environment 
- Demonstrate i.e. that the pull request process satisfies requirements for change control policy doc

### Policy Pyeramid
- Principle - org values & culture
- Policy - DevOps Policy
- Standard - Technical Standards (aws, azure, gcp, docker, kubernetes, etc)
- Guideline - Best practices & controls
- Procedure - Integrate with CI/CD (steps to include sec scan, gain approvals, etc)
- Baseline - Benchmarks (aws, azure, gcp, docker, kubernetes, etc)

### [DevOps Audit Defense Toolkit](https://itrevolution.com/product/devops-audit-defense-toolkit/)
- Playbook for being audit-ready and defending your DevOps practices

### DevOps, CD, and ITIL
- ITIL very heavyweight, waterfall-focused
    - Does not work well with DevOps
    - ING paper "[ITIL and DevOps are at war in the enterprise](https://www.slideshare.net/JanJoostBouwman/20140620-dev-opsdaysamsterdam-for-publication)"
    - CapitalOne [creation of the Clean Room Project](https://www.simform.com/blog/capital-one-devops-case-study/#:~:text=In%20simple%20words%2C%20“clean%20room,and%20ensure%20quality%20from%20scratch.)

    http://www.devopsonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-29-at-14.29.53.png

### Other control frameworks
- CIS Controls: Ctrl 13 - Network monitoring and defense
- PCI: Rqmt 6 - Develop and maintain secure systems and apps
    - [good story from Etsy about this](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/how-etsy-migrate-its-pci-environment-to-offset-risk)


### CIS Foundations Benchmarks
- AWS: IAM, Storage, Logging, Monitoring, Networking => AWS Security Hub; AWS Trusted Advisor, Config; InSpec AWS Rsrc Pack; MITRE AWS InSpec profile
- Azure: IM, Defender for Cloud, Storage Accts, Db svcs, Logging and monitor, networking, vms, other sec considerations, ...

### Those tools are great, but don't cover everything
- InSpec: using resource packs by chef to interrogate cloud resources. 
    - custom stories for eval, ie checking allowed ports/ips
    - good to check into repos and run post-deploy to validate controls and policies
    - easily converted to unit test format for pass/fail

### Other policy-as-code options
- AWS Service COntrol Policies (SCP)
    - Constraints to an org, OU, or account
    - allow/deny access to AWS svcs, actions, regions
- AWS IAM Permission Boundaries 
    - guardrail for a principal
- Azure Policy
    - adherence to compliance and config stds
    - Comes with numerous built-in policies for reg compliance (CIS, FedRAMP, HIPAA, ISO 27001, NIST, etc)
    - [written in JSON and public avail on github](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy)

- Cloud Security Tools
    - CSPM - Cloud Sec Posture Mgmt  - wizio, orca, Prowler, scoutsuite
        - AWS Security Hub // MS Defender for Cloud
            - MS Defender for Cloud pushes into multi-cloud, can ingest AWS data
            - Prowler: "the best"
    - CWPP - Cloud Workload Protection Platform - threat intel based; sysdig, prisma cloud, trend micro cloud one
    - CASB - Cloud Access Security Broker - SaaS platforms on top of CSP
